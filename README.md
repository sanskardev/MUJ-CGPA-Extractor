# MUJ-CGPA-Extractor
This is a code to find the CGPA of MUJ students if you have their registration numbers and date of births.

This was uploaded about a year after it was made. It does not work now because a captcha has been added on the DMS website to increase security (lol sure). The data set used was details of BTech students of 2018-2022 batch. There might also be some errors in the code because I might have tweaked some things after it was made and did not check afterwards.

However, it is still possible to do this despite the captcha, the only difference would be to use pytesseract module to extract text from the captcha image. Contact me if you have a query/ need more information :)
